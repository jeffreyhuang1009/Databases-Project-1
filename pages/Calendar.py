'''
This is the project calendar 
There is an instance of this created when a project is created.
Users cannot create multiple calendars for one project, and users cannot delete one project for that calendar.

The events class will also be created in here. This event object will look just as a normal event being added to a calendar looks. Model this after google calendar. =
